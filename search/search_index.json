These decisions shape both the current state of a project and its long-term trajectory. Over time, the rationale for these decisions can get lost if they are not written down. One certainty in software development is that there will at some point be a need, or a desire, to change and adapt to new requirements, technologies and best practices.</p> <p>Without knowing why a decision was made, there is a risk that future developers will not feel empowered to make changes. This will lead to the accumulation of technical debt when working around the current architecture in the short-term and, in the long-term, will make the project obsolete. Conversely, there may be a very good reason for sticking to the original decision but if future developers are not aware of this reason they may make changes that must later be reverted, wasting time and effort. Nygard refers to these two alternatives as \"blind acceptance\" and \"blind reversal\" in a 2011 blog post on documenting architectural decisions, which we recommend reading for additional context.</p> <p>Another force to consider, at the time of writing in 2025, is the rapid adoption of AI tools for software development. A future developer may defer to an AI coding assistant or agent to recommend changes. Unless there is an AI-readable record of the rationale for earlier decisions, these tools are more likely to recommend reversing those they see as suboptimal. If this record exists, however, AI can be used more effectively to evolve a project and help onboard new developers (e.g. by providing summaries, answering questions and explaining the rationale behind certain choices).</p>","tags":["docs"]},{"location":"architecture/adr/001-use-architectural-decision-records/#problem-statement","title":"Problem Statement","text":"<p>How do we share the rationale for architectural decisions with future human or AI developers so that they can make more informed choices that ensure the continuity and evolvability of the project?</p>","tags":["docs"]},{"location":"architecture/adr/001-use-architectural-decision-records/#options-considered","title":"Options Considered","text":"Option Description Maintainability Knowledge Retention Traceability AI Usability Effort Discoverability Overall score Notes Weight - 1 2 1 1 1 1 - ADR Architectural Decision Record \u2705 \u2705 \u2705 \u2705 \u26a0\ufe0f \u2705 21 Docs Architecture page in docs \u2705 \u2705 \u26a0\ufe0f \u26a0\ufe0f \u2705 \u2705 20 README Architecture section in README \u2705 \u2705 \u26a0\ufe0f \u26a0\ufe0f \u2705 \u26a0\ufe0f 19 Diagrams Flowcharts of decision trees \u26a0\ufe0f \u26a0\ufe0f \u274c \u274c \u26a0\ufe0f \u26a0\ufe0f 11 <p>\u2705 = 3 (good), \u26a0\ufe0f = 2 (acceptable), \u274c = 1 (poor)</p> <p>Maintaining a collection of Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) has been standard practice in industry, beginning the 1990s and popularised by Nygard's 2011 blog post. ADRs are small text files, written in Markdown, that describe the context, the decision, and the consequences of the decision (both good and bad). They ensures a detailed decision history that is human and AI-readable. Several templates for ADRs have been developed and are in use. These vary in the number of sections and level of detail and can be customised. They are easy to maintain and provide the best way to retain history of rationale for decisions but there is a larger effort involved in creating and reviewing them.</p> <p>Informal documentation in the project README or docs requires less effort and is easy to maintain but the history is mostly in the git commits and is harder to find and evaluate by humans. Using the documentation rather than the README makes the information more discoverable.</p> <p>Flowcharts provide a human-friendly visual overview but are more difficult to maintain and not as AI-friendly (although flowcharts as code is AI-friendly and might work well as a supplement if they are kept up-to-date).</p>","tags":["docs"]},{"location":"architecture/adr/001-use-architectural-decision-records/#decision-outcome","title":"Decision Outcome","text":"<p>We will keep a collection of Architectural Decision Records using a template based on MADR, which extends the template proposed by Nygard to include evaluating alternatives, which provides additional valuable knowledge to share with future developers and facilitates a re-evaluation at a later date.</p> <p>The title in the ADR file will use the pattern <code>ADR-NNN: &lt;Verb&gt; &lt;Object&gt; [optional qualifier]</code>, where NNN is a zero padded three digit number (e.g. ADR-001: Use Architectural Decision Records). ADRs will be numbered sequentially and monotonically.

To avoid false precision, a simple scoring system will be used to rate an option as either good (\u2705), ok (\u26a0\ufe0f) or poor (\u274c). Emoticons will be used to provide human readers with a quick visual overview. These are also readable by current AI tools, such as ChatGPT, and keeping a legend with numerical scoring improves AI-readability. Optional weights will represent the relative importance of drivers and an overall score used to rank the options. A short description will supplement and summarise this decision matrix.</p> <p>The Decision Outcome section states the final decision and the justification based on the results of the decision matrix evaluation. It is stated in full sentences, with active voice.</p> <p>A Consequences section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. This should describe both the positive and negative impacts of the decision on the project and should also list any unknowns or risks (and optionally what should be done to mitigate these risks).</p> <p>The whole document should be one or two pages long.
